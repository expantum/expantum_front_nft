                        determining which game object metadata should be on-chain and what needs to be covered by the

                        great reward system instead of having a game that people simply want to make money out of. Our
                        whitepaper outlines the tokenomics of the in-game token and the in-game utility, classification,
                        rarity tiers, and all other information pertaining to our NFTs. Our NFT royalties are set up in
                        a way that prevents large fluctuations in our NFT floor price, preventing high barriers to entry
                        like many of the current crypto games. </p>
